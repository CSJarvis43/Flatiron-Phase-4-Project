Pokemon Locator

This idea behind this project is to build an app that you can use when you are playing any of the pokemon games. You will be able to search for a pokemon and figure out what route it inhabits, so you can go catch it in-game

User Stories:

    * The user comes to the site, sees a list of pokemon, finds one they want to catch, and can click to see its data
    * The user comes to the site, searches the name or ID number of the pokemon, and can see detailed data about that pokemon
    * The user comes to the site with an idea of the team that they want to create. They are able to search through to find the desired pokemon and add them to a favorites list
    * The user wants to filter by a certain type of pokemon, they can see all of the pokemon available of a certain type, to help narrow things down
    * The user wants to create a team each with a certain moveset, so they can view pokemon by what moves they can learn, and build their team based on that
